# MoxiePoker
An iPad Video Poker Simulation written in Objective C and C/C++. It was built and released along with the original iPad in 2008.  I developed the software and Jef Lear, http://www.learcodesign.com/, designed the visuals and the sound. 

The game is available in the app store for free at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moxie-poker/id369632464?ls=1&mt=8
